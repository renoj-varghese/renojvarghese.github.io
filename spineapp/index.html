It is part of a University of Connecticut research study.
We were tasked to redesign the app to improve the user experience of managing chronic pain</h2><div class="goals grid-3 flex mt-xxl"><div class="grid-3-item left"><p class="bold">Goal 1</p><p class="project-p">Improve the usability of the Spine App</p></div><div class="grid-3-item middle"><p class="bold">Goal 2</p><p class="project-p">Give the Spine App a new visual design language</p></div><div class="grid-3-item right"><p class="bold">Goal 3</p><p class="project-p">Create Learning Module Videos to inform users about chronic low back pain</p></div></div><div class="img-container"><img src="../static/img/husky/mockup.png" alt="mockup.png"></div><h6 id="research"> </h6></div><div class="content-container"><h3>Usability Tests</h3><p class="project-p">Researchers had already conducted user tests by asking participants to walk through case scenarios. They recorded and audio and video to analyze results.</p><h3>Analysis of Current App</h3><p class="project-p">The design team reviewed the current app alongside stakeholders to gain an understanding of the requirements. Some limitations of the current app were
that users lacked the ability to manage their goals, users were frustrated when going through video modules, the modules lacked appeal, and researchers were not able to track user activities.     </p><div class="img-container"><img src="../static/img/husky/original-ui.png" alt="original-ui.png"></div><h3 class="mt-separate">Key Insights and Opportunties</h3><div class="i-o"><h4 class="insight">Users had trouble navigating the important tasks of understanding learning modules, logging physical activity,and tracking goals.</h4><p class="opportunity">An opportunity is to improve the usability of the app to make it easier for users to fully engage in managing chronic back pain.</p></div><div class="i-o"><h4 class="insight">Not much time was dedicated to the visual design and feeling of the app. </h4><p class="opportunity">An opportunity is to put in the time to develop a visual design language. </p></div><div class="i-o"><h4 class="insight">Video modules are not engaging to users to follow and complete activities.</h4><p class="opportunity">An opportunity is to provide visualizations to help users learn about back pain.</p></div><h6 id="ui-design"></h6><h3 class="mt-separate">Information Architecture</h3><p class="project-p">Usability research showed that users had trouble navigating the app to find learning modules, set goals, and track activities. One of the first steps in the redesign process was to simplify the information architecture to tackle these usability concerns.</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../static/img/husky/information_architecture.png" alt="information_architecture.png"></div><h3 class="mt-separate">Visual Design Components</h3><p class="project-p">One of the main endeavors was to give the SpineApp visual depth. The following design system represents the organic and calm mood established in the app. </p><div class="img-container"><img src="../static/img/husky/visual-design.jpg" alt="visual-design.jpg"></div><h3 class="mt-separate">Updated User Flows</h3><p class="project-p">For each feature of the app, the team restructured the flow to better solve user problems. Video modules were simplified and incorporated more engaging content. Goals and activities were connected to help users understand the progress in managing chronic low back pain. And finally the process of teleconferencing with nurses included ways to schedule Zoom meetings. </p><div class="img-container"><img src="../static/img/husky/complete-module-study.jpg" alt="complete-module-study.jpg"></div><div class="mt-separate"><div class="img-container"><img src="../static/img/husky/user-flow–goal-activity.png" alt="user-flow–goal-activity.png"></div></div><div class="mt-separate"><div class="img-container"><img src="../static/img/husky/user-flow–goal-checkin.png" alt="user-flow–goal-checkin.png"></div></div><div class="mt-separate"><div class="img-container"><img src="../static/img/husky/contact-nurses.jpg" alt="contact-nurses.jpg"></div></div><h6 id="motion-design"></h6><h3 class="mt-separate">Redesigning Video Learning Modules</h3><p class="project-p">Part of the project was to redesign the videos that were apart of the learning modules.
