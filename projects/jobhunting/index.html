JobHunting highlights some of the problems jobseekers face. This animation was a way for me to poke fun at some of the common job search stereotypes. When talking to friends about their experiences with the job search process, we had a lot in common. I incorporated these common experiences into the final animation. It was a way to talk about it without having to say anything at all. </p><h3 class="animate fade delay-large slide-down">Overview</h3><div class="grid-2 flex animate fade slide-down delay-large"><div class="grid-2-item left"><p class="mb-l"><strong>Roles: </strong>Motion Designer, Animator</p><p class="mb-l animate fade delay-large"><strong>Team: </strong>Solo, with help from peers and professors</p><p class="animate fade delay-large"><strong>Duration: </strong>4 Weeks</p></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><p class="mb-sm"><p class="project-p mb-m"><strong>Deliverables: </strong>A 2 minute animated short film.

An example scene that made it into the final cut is below.</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/jobhunting/jh-storyboard.png" alt="jh-storyboard.png"></div><h3 class="mt-separate">Typography</h3><p class="project-p">After designing the final storyboard, it was clear that animation would be text-heavy. I needed a typeface that could be easily read on digital screens. I explored Google Fonts to find a typeface that would be both legible and commical.</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/jobhunting/jh-typography.png" alt="jh-typography.png"></div><h3 class="mt-separate">Color</h3><p class="project-p">To represent the frustration behind a difficult job search, I used the main colors of fire: orange and red. Going to the other side of the color wheel, a cooling blue offered a great contrast and represented a calmer voice.</p><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/jobhunting/jh-colors.png" alt="jh-colors.png"></div></div><h3 class="mt-separate">Style Frames</h3><p class="project-p">The next stage combined my visual elements with my storyboards. Each style frame established a shot or scene to be animated later. It allowed me to play with how the type and color could work each other before adding in any motion. </p><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/jobhunting/style-frame.png" alt="style-frame.png"></div></div><p class="project-p mt-xxxl mt-separate">Because job applications are so text-heavy, I wanted to abstract the layers of text the audience did not need to see. In the style frame stage, I stumbled on a "wireframe" look that employed rectangles to represent text. It was successful in how it drew the audience to the text that was important for the narrative. </p><div class="mt-xl"></div><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/jobhunting/wireframe-style.png" alt="wireframe-style.png"></div></div><h3 class="mt-separate">Final Stills</h3><p class="project-p">Finally, I constructed scenes in Adobe After Effects to create the final cut. Below are some example shots from the animation.</p><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/jobhunting/final-stills.png" alt="final-stills.png"></div></div></div></div><div class="project-container content-container"><h6>conclusion</h6><h3>Results</h3><p class="project-p">The final animation was featured in the Metropolitan Computer Animation Festival.

A lot of music is copyrighted and could not be used in my animation. It took some time to decide on the right song, but I found the one that had a good sense of humor.</p><h5>Timing is Everything</h5><p class="mb-l">Like a dancer has to time themself to the music, I had to time my animation to the audio I chose. Storyboarding and creating After Effects Markers helped me time my animations to the music.</p><!--h3.mt-separate If I Had Unlimited Time, I Would--><!--ulli.mb-m 
    h5 Develop a Richer Design Language
    | If I had more time, I'd want to develop the colors and motion further. There could be more integration of the Principles of Animation. Another place to improve is the color language beyond just two or three colors.
