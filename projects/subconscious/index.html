They host a web platform where people can share their stories. The goal is help others with mental illnesses and build empathy with those who do not.--><!--h2 My mission was redesigning the initial experience readers have with Subconscious's web platform. The first touch is the most important experience to help the reader understand who the organization is and if they want to come back.--><p class="animate fade delay-small slide-down"> According to the World Health Organization, 1 in 4 adults has a mental illness. 
Subsconsious is dedicated to telling the stories of real people within this statistic. By featuring mental health stories on their website, they hope to help others understand their illness and build empathy with those who have never had one.</p><br><p class="animate fade delay-small slide-down mb-l">I came into the organization two years after their initial website was launched. There had not been any user testing or analysis on how it was performing. My role was to conduct this testing and redesign the site based on my findings.</p><div class="mb-l animate fade delay-large slide-down"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/mural-header.png" alt="mural-header.png"></div></div><h3 class="mt-xl animate fade delay-large slide-down">Overview</h3><div class="grid-2 flex animate fade delay-large slide-down"><div class="grid-2-item left"><p class="mb-l"><strong>Role: </strong>UX Researcher, UX Designer</p><p class="mb-l"><strong>Team: </strong>The Subconscious Team: Cathy Liu (Operations), Allison Chang (Operations), Robin Kuang (Design Mentor), and Jennifer Chiang (Content)</p><p class="mb-l"><strong>Contributions: </strong>User Testing, Personas, Journey Maps, Final Redesigns</p><p class="mb-l"><strong>Duration: </strong>10 Weeks</p></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><p class="mb-l"><strong>Deliverables </strong>The final deliverables for my work were personas and journey maps to support future redesign efforts as well as a final prototype of my redesign to development.</p><a class="btn mb-l" href="../../static/img/subconscious/persona-journey-map-subsconsious.pdf" target="_blank">View Final Personas and Journey Maps</a><a class="btn" href="https://invis.io/Y8TEMM1MPNR#/378465318_home-Mural" target="_blank">Visit Final Prototype</a></div></div></div><div class="tint-box project-extra-padding mt-separate"><div class="content-container"><h6>research</h6><h3>User Testing on the Original Website</h3><p class="project-p mb-m">The first step in the process was conducting user tests with real people.

With these, I was able to have a conversation with organization leaders on how we could better introduce Subconscious to new readers.
The documents guided my designs as I thought about how I could improve Jamie's and Tara's experiences on the Subconscious website.</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/personas-maps.png" alt="personas-maps.png"></div></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3 class="mt-xxxl mb-xl">Making Mental Health Stories Easier to Find</h3><div class="grid-2 flex mb-xl"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="img-container shadow mb-xxl"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/home-search-original.png" alt="home-search-original.png"></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><!--h5 Testing revealed that readers had trouble finding a story--><p><strong>Problem: </strong>When asked to find a specific story participants took 2-4 minutes to find. 2/7 participants were unable to find the story at all.
The main reason was that there were no search or filter tools. Participants had to scroll until they found the right article.</p></div></div><h4 class="mt-separate mb-xl">Exploration and Concepts</h4><div class="grid-3 flex mb-xl mt-xl"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="img-container shadow mb-xxl"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/home-wire-1.png" alt="home-wire-1.png"></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><h5 class="mb-m">Simple Search Bar</h5><p> <strong>Rationale:</strong>The initial idea was to give a open space to request a story. Most of the participants had an idea or topic that they wanted to search. The goal is give a space to provide that input.</p></div></div><div class="grid-2 flex mt-xl mb-xl"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="img-container shadow mb-xxl"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/home-wire-2.png" alt="home-wire-2.png"></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><h5 class="mb-m">Allowing Readers to Filter Stories By Search and Topic</h5><p> <strong>Rationale: </strong>One of the participants was unsure about specific topics in mental health did Subconscious focus on. I added a dropdown to list some example topics in case a similar user was unsure what they might find on the site. </p></div></div><h4 class="mt-separate">Final Solution</h4><div class="grid-2 flex mb-xxl"><div class="grid-2-item left"><p> <strong>Solution: </strong>The final design drew inspiration from the autofill function of a Google Search and AngelList to provide search suggestions. The goal is provide both an open space to search as well as direction on what can be found.</p></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><p> <strong>Success Criteria: </strong>Number of Searches, Number of stories viewed, percentage of successful searches (initiated a search and did view a story), Number of times Example Topics were used, Percentage of stories found without searching.</p></div></div><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/home-search.png" alt="home-search.png"></div><div class="caption mt-m align-center">Search and Filter goes a step further than a simple search bar to show what readers can find</div><h4 class="mt-separate">Full Homepage</h4><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/home-mural.png" alt="home-mural.png"></div><div class="caption mt-m align-center">Full Homescreen includes a hero section to introduce Subconscious and leads into searching for a story</div><div class="content-container project-container"></div><h3 class="mt-xxxl mb-xl">Making Donations Clear and Transparent</h3><div class="grid-2 flex mb-xl"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="img-container shadow mb-xxl"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/donations-original.png" alt="donations-original.png"></div><p class="caption mt-m">Categories do not paint a clear picture of how a donation is spent</p></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><!--h5 Testing revealed that readers had trouble finding a story--><p><strong>Problem: </strong>4/7 participants who reported that they would be unlikely to donate were also unsure about how their donation would support Subconscious. 
The description of where donations go was too ambigious and left participants uncertain of what their money would be used for.  </p></div></div><h4 class="mt-separate mb-xl">Exploration and Concepts</h4><div class="grid-2 flex mt-xl mb-xl"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="img-container shadow mb-xxl"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/donate-wire-1.png" alt="donate-wire-1.png"></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><h5>Percentage Breakdown</h5><p> <strong>Rationale: </strong>Participants from testing noted how the site was vague about where donations go. I collaborated with the operations officer to go over their yearly expenditures.
We thought of displaying this breakdown on the website to have a specific breakdown of where donation money goes. </p></div></div><div class="grid-2 flex mb-xl mt-xl"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="img-container shadow mb-xxl"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/donate-wire-2.png" alt="donate-wire-2.png"></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><h5>Highlight Successes in Events and Articles</h5><p> <strong>Rationale: </strong>Another approach was to showcase the impact a donation will have. Subconsicous publishes some articles on they events they run or milestones in their non-profit journey. Highlighting these moments could give a better picture of what a donation will support.</p></div></div><h4 class="mt-separate">Final Solution</h4><div class="grid-2 flex mb-xxl"><div class="grid-2-item left"><p> <strong>Solution: </strong>The key problem from user testing seemed to be the vague descriptions of where donations go. A visual percentage breakdown added the transparency they were searching for. 
In addition, some elements of the breakdown have links to articles that highlight accomplisments. </p></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><p> <strong>Success Criteria: </strong>Number of donations, amount of money donated, views of donation grid, qualitative feedback from surveys or user testing</p></div></div><div class="img-container shadow mb-xxl"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/donate-grid copy.png" alt="donate-grid copy.png"></div><div class="caption mt-m mb-l align-center">Redesign openly breaks down expenses from previous fiscal year</div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>A/B Testing</h3><p class="project-p">My design mentor and I were curious about how people would react to donations with and without explicit percentages. To test this, we created an A/B test on Usertesting.com.

Redesigning the web platform gave me more perspective into the struggles and journies of people I never had designed for.
Hearing these stories not only helped me build empathy with potential users but also reinforced the Subconscious mission of learning about the people behind a diagnosis.</p><h5>Conducting Unmoderated User Testing</h5><p class="mb-l">This was the first time I created an unmoderated user test. The challenge was to create a comprehensive test plan that covered the experience of a reader exploring the website. I woudn't be able to moderate or delve deeper into user insights. I previewed the test multiple times and received feedback from my design mentor to ensure that my questions and tasks would touch upon multiple parts of the website. </p></div><div class="content-container project-container project-extra-padding"><a href="../../"><h3 class="mb-s small-caps">go back to home</h3></a></div></div><footer class="footer"></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="../../main.js"></script></body></html>
