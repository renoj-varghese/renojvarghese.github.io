The first touchpoint is important to convince the reader the value of mental health storytelling. </h2><div class="goals grid-3 flex mt-xxl animate fade delay-med slide-down"><div class="grid-3-item left"><p class="bold">Goal 1</p><p class="project-p">Simplify finding mental health stories and resources.</p></div><div class="grid-3-item middle"><p class="bold">Goal 2</p><p class="project-p">Introduce the Subconscious organization, its mission, and history.</p></div><div class="grid-3-item right"><p class="bold">Goal 3</p><p class="project-p">Showcase how donations support Subconcious's mission.</p></div></div><h3 class="animate fade delay-large slide-down">Overview</h3><p class="mb-l animate fade delay-large slide-down"><strong>Role: </strong>UX Researcher, UX Designer</p><p class="mb-l animate fade delay-large slide-down"><strong>Team: </strong>The Subconscious Team: Cathy Liu (Operations), Allison Chang (Operations), Robin Kuang (Design Mentor), and Jennifer Chiang (Content)</p><p class="mb-l animate fade delay-large slide-down"> <strong>Contributions: </strong>User Testing, Personas, Journey Maps, Final Redesigns</p><p class="animate fade delay-large slide-down"><strong>Duration: </strong>10 Weeks</p></div><div class="project-extra-padding"><div class="content-container"><h6>research</h6><h3>Research on UserTesting.com</h3><p class="project-p">The first step in the process was conducting user tests with real people.

With these, I was able to have a conversation with organization leaders on how we could better introduce Subconscious to new readers.
The documents guided my designs as I thought about how I could improve Jamie's and Tara's experiences on the Subconscious website.</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/personas-maps.png" alt="personas-maps.png"></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Frequent Stakeholder Checkins</h3><p class="project -p">A key element in the design and research process was frequently meeting with members of the operations, design, and content teams. Their feedback helped me understand the aspirations for Subconscious and incorporate the team's ideas in the final redesign.</p></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h6>design</h6><h3>Sketches and Concepts</h3><p class="project-p">The next step was to hit the ground running and think of solutions. The best tool for this was paper and pen to explore many ideas in a short amount of time.</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/sketches.png" alt="sketches.png"></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>High Fidelity Prototype</h3><p class="mb-l">Since there was an already established design system, I could easily convert my sketches into a high fidelity prototype. With 2-3 design iterations and frequent checkins with stakeholders, I developed the following solutions.</p><h3 class="mt-xxxl mb-m">Designing the Homepage to Make Stories Easier to Find</h3><div class="grid-2 flex mb-xl"><div class="grid-2-item left"><p><strong>Problem: </strong>When asked to find a specific story participants took 2-4 minutes to find. 2/7 participants were unable to find the story at all.</p></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><p> <strong>Solution: </strong>Adding a search and filter tool on the homepage could help readers find stories.</p></div></div><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/home-search.png" alt="home-search.png"></div><div class="caption mt-m align-center">Search and Filter goes a step further than a simple search bar to show what readers can find</div><h3 class="mt-separate mb-m">Telling Subconscious's Story To Increase Clarity</h3><div class="grid-2 flex mb-xl"><div class="grid-2-item left"><p><strong>Problem: </strong>6/7 participants had questions about how Subconscious started, who the team was, and why the organization was created.</p></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><p> <strong>Solution: </strong>Include more information on Subconscious's history.

Using UserTesting.com again, I conducted two sets of user tests focusing on how we could present the Donations page.

But to test with users, I needed more realistic copy for readers to get an understanding of who Subconscious is.
The Operations and Content teams volunteered to do copywriting, while I could focus on the design.</p><h3 class="mt-separate">Next Steps</h3><h5>Getting the Site Live</h5><p class="project-p">The current redesign is under development.
