The purpose is to be able to contact those who have legislative power. The idea for the application
came from the Battle for Net Neutrality campaign, which displayed every representative's 
contact information. I wanted to replicate that in a more general app.</span><div class="role-container"><label class="role-name">Role: UX Researcher &amp; UX/UI Designer. </label>To create the app, I conducted a competitive analysis on similar apps, wrote user stories based on what was missing, created wireframes to put my ideas on paper, and a final prototype to test the app.</div><div class="external-links"><a class="btn" href="https://gov-contact.herokuapp.com"><div class="label">View First Prototype</div></a><a class="btn" href="https://invis.io/HSRFG9VWNAQ"><div class="label">View Second Iteration Prototype</div></a></div></p></div><h2 class="problem">How might we make it simpler to find a government representative?</h2><h2 class="project-header">Research</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span>There are many applications (mobile and web) that can find U.S. governmental offcials.
My methodology for research was to understand their user experience and see what could be improved. 
The research spanned government, non-profit, and commercial organizations. 
I conducted a competitive analysis, looking at where this app could make an impact.
Here are some of my insights that I wanted to bring to GovContact:</span><ul class="project-list"><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Do not focus on specific issues: </strong>A couple of the applications were focused on highlighting specific issues.
Though it encouraged people to contact their representatives, this app should be more neutral</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>No requirement for creating an account or signing up by email: </strong>One aspect that GovContact should avoid is trying to get citizens to sign up for an app.
The onboarding process should be as quick as possible and limited to entering a physical address</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Lower complexity: </strong>For this app, I wanted to create a tool people could quickly and simply reach their representatives.
Something that would be </li><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/govcontact_analysis.jpg" alt="wireframes"><div class="caption">Part of the matrix for my competitive analysis.</div></div></ul></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Process</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/govcontact_process.jpg" alt="wireframes"><div class="caption"></div></div><h3 class="project-subheader">User Stories</h3><span>The following user stories represent what GovContact is able to do.
Writing user stories helped me think inside the shoes of someone who might use this app.</span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/govcontact_user-stories.jpg" alt="wireframes"><div class="caption"></div></div><h3 class="project-subheader">Wireframes</h3><span>After writing user stories, I went to design the interface for GovContact.
I chose to showcase government representatives in a card style to encapsulate all the information
about that representative in one place.</span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/govcontact_wireframes.jpg" alt="wireframes"><div class="caption"></div></div><h3 class="project-subheader">Styles and Icons</h3><span>The colors and icons for the app. I went with the classic red, white, and blue, 
since I was focusing on government representatives in the U.S.A.</span><div class="img-container white-bg"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/style-guide.png" alt="styles"><div class="caption"></div></div></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Solution and Feedback</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span>The first prototype was created using React.js and Google Civic API. Here are screenshots of the 
first prototype. It can also be found by clicking </span><a class="link" href="https://gov-contact.herokuapp.com">here. </a><span>Testing the app revealed that:</span><ul class="project-list"><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Less red, white and blue: </strong>Users tended to prefer a more neutral color palette. Maybe the app could be expanded to other countries than the U.S.</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Possible find user's location automatically: </strong>Though it was never mentioned, a later thought was to be able to track a user's location through their browser.
It would eliminate any steps a person would need to take to find a government official</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Would be best as a mobile app: </strong>Almost every interviewee said they would be unlikely to go onto the site when they wanted to talk to their represenative.  
It would be more likely that a user would use Google to find the person they wished to contact.
One user commented how GovContact would be better as a mobile app. It would be like having your senator as one of your personal contacts.</li></ul><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/final-result.png" alt="final"><div class="caption"></div></div><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/final-result2.png" alt="final"><div class="caption"></div></div></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Second Iteration</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span>Taking this feedback, I made a second prototype as a mobile app. A lesson I learned was that code prototypes take a long time.
