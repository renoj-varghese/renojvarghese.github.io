The purpose is to be able to contact those who have legislative power. The idea for the application
came from the Battle for Net Neutrality campaign, which displayed every representative's 
contact information. I wanted to replicate that in a more general web application, where everyone could acccess this information with just a link.</span><div class="role-container"><label class="role-name">Role: UX Researcher &amp; UX/UI Designer. </label>As part of a class project, I conducted a competitive analysis on similar web apps, wrote user stories based on what was missing, created wireframes to put my ideas on paper, and a final prototype to test the app.</div><div class="external-links"><a class="btn" href="https://gov-contact.herokuapp.com"><div class="label">View First Prototype</div></a><a class="btn" href="https://invis.io/HSRFG9VWNAQ"><div class="label">View Second Iteration Prototype</div></a></div></p></div><h2 class="problem">How might we make it simpler to find a government representative?</h2><h2 class="project-header">Process</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/govcontact_process.jpg" alt="process"><div class="caption"></div></div></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Research</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><h3 class="project-subheader">Initial Project Pitch</h3><p class="project-p"><span class="project-p">By pitching my idea to the class, I was able to get some initial insight on how to design this web app.
The main piece of feedback I received was to keep the application simple as possible for someone to learn about their representatives.
This meant leaving out any signup forms, providing a simple set of set of instructions, and mapping the fewest number of steps to lead people to contact their representative. </span></p><h3 class="project-subheader">Competitive Analysis</h3><p class="project-p"><span class="project-p">There are many applications (mobile and web) that can find U.S. governmental offcials.
My methodology for research was to understand their user experience and see what could be improved. 
The research spanned government, non-profit, and commercial organizations. 
I conducted a competitive analysis, looking at where this app could make an impact.
Here are some of my insights that I wanted to bring to GovContact:</span><ul class="project-list"><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Do not focus on specific issues: </strong>A couple of the applications were focused on highlighting specific issues.
Though it encouraged people to contact their representatives, this app should be more neutral</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>No requirement for creating an account or signing up by email: </strong>One aspect that GovContact should avoid is trying to get citizens to sign up for an app.
The onboarding process should be as quick as possible and limited to entering a physical address</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Keep it Simple: </strong>For this app, I wanted to create a tool people could quickly and simply reach their representatives.
Something that would be </li><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/govcontact_analysis.jpg" alt="wireframes"><div class="caption">Part of the matrix for my competitive analysis.</div></div></ul></p><h3 class="project-subheader">Personas</h3><p class="project-p"><span class="project-p">Personas helped me think about user needs and how someone might use GovContact.
I tackled the problem from two perspectives. One is Briana Jackson, who could use GovContact on a regular basis when she wants to talk to a politician or give a supporter a way to find their representative.
Another perspective is Terry Mendoza, who would use the app for a limited time to tell his story to his legislators. </span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/persona_briana.png" alt="Persona Briana Jackson"><div class="caption"></div></div><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/persona_terry.png" alt="Persona Terry Mendoza"><div class="caption"></div></div></p></p></div><h2 class="project-header">User Stories</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span class="project-p">The following user stories represent what GovContact is able to do.
Writing user stories helped me think inside the shoes of someone who might use this app.
I considered how Terry could find the names of the state legislators making a decision on a free tuition bill.
Briana should be able to use GovContact to find channels to communicate with a politician directly, such as through phone, email or social media. </span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/govcontact_user-stories.jpg" alt="user stories"><div class="caption"></div></div></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Wireframes</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><h3 class="project-subheader">Deciding What Contact Information To Have</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span class="project-p">One of the main challenges of this app is to decide which forms of contact to provide to citizens.
Every Government representative has a phone line and email, and a strong majority of officials utilize social media. 
Representatives also have websites as well.
People can also send in hand letters to a physical address. There's also the question of showcasing the political party which each official belongs to.
With so many options it was difficult to choose what contact info to show.

Examples of my information experiments can be found below
</span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/govcontact_wireframes-cards.png" alt="wireframes"><div class="caption"></div></div><span class="project-p">To make a final decision, I considered solving the problem by balancing:</span><ul class="project-list"><li class="project-list-item"><strong>What is most accessible to someone using this app: </strong>Considering the web platform, it is easy to assume that someone has internet connection and is on their laptop/phone.
Briana and Terry would both need contact information that they could immediately use
The fastest ways to contact a representative would be through email, social media, and a phone call.</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>What are the most effective ways to contact a representative: </strong>For this portion, I conducted some online research to learn what contact methods are most influentional.
From an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/us/politics/heres-why-you-should-call-not-email-your-legislators.html">article </a>by Daniel, it seemed that phone calls were effective to contact a representative directly or atleast their office.
It was also considered to be more effective in state and local governments. This is particuraly important for Terry, who trying to get a state law to pass, and Briana who hopes the law will support her local community. 
According to a <a href="https://www.azavea.com/blog/2017/10/03/whats-the-best-way-to-contact-your-representatives/">study </a> done by Azavea where 1000 government officials were surveyed,
the top 3 forms of contact were email (77% approved), social media (13%), and phone (11%)
With email with such strong approval and accessiblity, an email address should be provided.
Alongside email, there should be some social media handles. Based on a <a href="https://www.quorum.us/data-driven-insights/congress-social-media-2018/412/">survey on social media </a>done by a site called Quorum, it seemed that politicians were most active on Facebook and Twitter. </li></ul><h3 class="project-subheader">Final Wireframes</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span class="project-p">The final decision for contact info was to include a phone number, an email address, and links to at least Twitter and Facebook.
</span><span class="project-p">To keep it as simple, the web app is a search screen, similar to Google or another search engine. 
The query is to type in a home address, which is the most accurate key to find a person's representatives.</span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/govcontact_wireframes.jpg" alt="wireframes"><div class="caption"></div></div></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Styles and Icons</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span class="project-p">The colors and icons for the app. I went with the classic red, white, and blue, 
since I was focusing on government representatives in the U.S.A. 
To convey the governmental nature of the app, graphics were designed around stars, flags, and government buildings.
The colors helped accent this tone. 
Color was also important to indicate political party.
Democrats would be given a blue icon, republicans would given a red icon, an independents/moderates/unknown party would not given an icon.
The fonts Lato and Roboto offered strong readability. Varying fonts better highlighted information (e.g. Lato Bold for a representative's name)</span><div class="img-container white-bg"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/style-guide.png" alt="styles"><div class="caption"></div></div></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Feedback</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span>The first prototype was created using React.js and Google Civic API. Here are screenshots of the 
first prototype. It can also be found by clicking </span><a class="link" href="https://gov-contact.herokuapp.com">here. </a><span class="project-p">Testing the app revealed that:</span><ul class="project-list"><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Less red, white and blue: </strong>Users tended to prefer a more neutral color palette. The app could be expanded to other countries than the U.S. The use of red and blue may have conveyed the feeling of political parties more than government itself. 
As a designer, it's tough to hear that colors don't work well. But maybe there's a better way to give the right feel for GovContact.</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Possibly find user's location automatically: </strong>Though it was never mentioned, a later thought was to be able to track a user's location through their browser.
It would eliminate any steps a person would need to take to find a government official</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Would likely not be used on a website: </strong>Almost every interviewee said they would be unlikely to go onto the site when they wanted to talk to their represenative.  
They were more likely to use a search engine instead. </li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Would be better as a mobile app: </strong>One user commented how GovContact would be better as a mobile app. It would be like having your senator as one of your personal contacts.
Even though this was only one user's input, the feedback hinted on the other users' needs. It is easy to forget a link or use a search engine instead.
But as a mobile app, GovContact is given greater weight and semblance inside a user's phone. </li></ul><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/final-result.png" alt="final"><div class="caption"></div></div><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/final-result2.png" alt="final"><div class="caption"></div></div></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Solution</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span>Taking this feedback, I made a second prototype as a mobile app. A lesson I learned was that code prototypes take a long time.
