Testing consisted of citizens using a prototype in an interview format and answering followup questions.
Mentors provided more formal critique.

Civic engagement is a complicated issue that I had to learn about before I could start designing for it. The most effective forms of research were the focus group and government employee interviews. Talking to real people helped me develop a greater sense of empathy of what people needed in a civic engagment app.</p><h5>Consider Visual Design Early On</h5><p class="mb-l">To develop a richer visual language, I started the process early. The goal was to make each design choice have a meaning, which would require a longer period of time to develop.</p><h3 class="mt-xxxl">Next Steps</h3><h5>Compare Reps Across Issues</h5><p class="mb-l"> Instead of learning about representatives individually, an interesting feature would be to compare all your representative stances based on a political issue.</p><h5>Message History</h5><p class="mb-l"> One the features that would be needed is an inbox feature that citizens could use to keep track of where their messages ended up and if they received a response. Currently GovContact would send an email to citizens that they could continue further correspondence. </p></div><div class="content-container project-container project-extra-padding"><a href="../../"><h3 class="mb-s small-caps">go back to home</h3></a></div></div><footer class="footer"></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="../../main.js"></script></body></html>
