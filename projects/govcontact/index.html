Conversations between citizens happen over social media, but there should more communication with legistators: those who have the immediate power to make effective change.
As part of a class project, I decided to tackle this specific problem by designing an app that helps citizens contact their representatives more often.
UX design can play a role in political activisim by ideating the technology to help us better communicate.</span><div class="role-container"><label class="role-name">Role: UX Researcher &amp; UX/UI Designer. </label>Conducted user research, ideated personas to empathize with, wrote user stories on their needs, 
created wireframes to put my ideas on paper, made prototypes of the app, and tested it with real users.
Aftewards I created a second prototype from the new ideas that came from user testing.</div></p></div><h2 class="problem">How might we help U.S. citizens contact their government representatives?</h2><h2 class="project-header">Research</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><h3 class="project-subheader">Initial Focus Group</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>The initial focus group was composed of my classmates, all of whom were at or above voting age. 
I presented my idea in class to hear some of the questions and frustrations a citizen might have. 
We talked about how most only knew who their Congressmen and Governor were. 
If one of my classmates were to contact a representative, they would use a search engine to find a representatives social media or email address. 
This research was a good primer to think about how a citizen would need contact information for all their representatives at the federal, state, and local levels. </span><h3 class="project-subheader">Competitive Analysis</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>There are many applications (mobile and web) that can find U.S. governmental offcials.
My methodology for research was to understand their user experience and see what could be improved. 
Part of this research was to also read the reviews of these apps (the good, the bad, and the odd). 
The research spanned government, non-profit, and commercial organizations. </span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/ca-logos.jpg" alt="competitive analysis icons"><div class="caption"></div></div><h3 class="project-subheader">Online Research</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>News articles and statstics were useful to understand <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/us/politics/heres-why-you-should-call-not-email-your-legislators.html">who responds to citizen communication</a>, <a href="https://www.azavea.com/blog/2017/10/03/whats-the-best-way-to-contact-your-representatives/">some effective ways of contact </a>, and <a href="https://www.quorum.us/data-driven-insights/congress-social-media-2018/412/">how active representatives are on social media</a>.
The research helped picture what were the best methods of contacting a representative in both terms of efficacy and availability.
It is crucial to understand this when deciding what contact info (email, phone, social media handles etc) to provide.</span><h3 class="project-subheader">Contacting my own Representatives</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>The best way to understand the process of contacting a government representative is to contact a government representative. 
I called 5 representatives' offices to interview someone working there.
I learned that it is usually an intern or staff member that receives the call/email/letter. The message is usually recorded as part of a tally or redirected to the proper office.
A caller can receive immediate feedback over the phone. An email or letter will usually receive a templated response. 
Understanding this process helped me make key design decisions in the future. </span><h3 class="project-subheader">Personas</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>The culminating result of the previous research: the personas to empathize with during the design process.
I tackled the problem from two perspectives. One is Briana Jackson, a nurse who could reguarly use this app in her activism.
Another perspective is Terry Mendoza, who would use the app for a limited time to tell his story to legislators. </span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/persona_briana.png" alt="Persona Briana Jackson"><div class="caption"></div></div><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/persona_terry.png" alt="Persona Terry Mendoza"><div class="caption"></div></div><h3 class="project-subheader">Key Insights</h3><p class="project-p"></p><ul class="project-list"><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Representative information varies greatly between apps: </strong> Some apps show only Congressmen. Some show only state legislators. 
For GovContact, it is important to show representatives at every level: federal, state, local.
Local officials can have just a large an impact on daily life as a Senator. All reps should be available to a citizen.</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Finding contact info can take some time: </strong>Many applications I found are bogged down with account creation and email registration. 
These barriers might prevent citizens from contacting their reps.</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Political neutrality is important: </strong>From the focus group and reading user reviews of current apps, citizens would care about political neutrality in an app.
It wouldn't be fair to be bias towards a political party. On the same logic, the app shouldn't push specific issues or include advertisements.</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Frequency is the key to getting through: </strong>From the conversations with representatives' offices, it seemed that citizens need to contact their representatives frequently to be effective.
A call or email may take 5 minutes. If this action were taken by many people at the same time, government officials would have to listen.
GovContact should be that app that help citizens take this action to make effective change.</li></ul></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Initial Idea: Web App</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"></p></div><div class="project-p">The first idea was to create GovContact as a web application. It would be accessible to anyone with internet access.
There would be no app to download. And it can provide up-to-date information on a consistent basis. Briana and Terry could use a simple link to have access to their representatives when they needed to make their voices heard.

</div><h2 class="project-header">User Stories</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span class="project-p">The following user stories represent what GovContact is able to do.
Writing user stories helped me think inside the shoes of someone who might use this app.
I considered how Terry could find the names of the state legislators making a decision on a free tuition bill.
Briana should be able to use GovContact to find channels to communicate with a politician directly, such as through phone, email or social media. </span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/govcontact_user-stories.jpg" alt="user stories"><div class="caption"></div></div></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Wireframes</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><h3 class="project-subheader">Deciding What Contact Information To Have</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span class="project-p">One of the main challenges of this app is to decide which forms of contact to provide to citizens.
Every Government representative has a phone line and email, and most officials utilize social media. 
Representatives have websites as well.
People can also send in hand letters to a physical address. 
With so many options it was difficult to choose what contact info to show. 
It is better to choose a small subset of information to showcase rather than overwhelm the user with all the contact information.

Examples of my information experiments can be found below:</span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/govcontact_wireframes-cards.png" alt="wireframes"><div class="caption"></div></div><h3 class="project-subheader">Final Wireframes</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span class="project-p">The final decision for contact info was to include a phone number, an email address, and links to at least Twitter and Facebook.
The online research and interviews with government employees supported my decision on three areas: (1) efficacy, (2) digital availability, and (3) convenience of each contact.
</span><span class="project-p">To keep it simple, the web app is a search screen, similar to Google or another search engine. 
The query is to type in a home address, which is the most accurate key to find a person's representatives.</span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/govcontact_wireframes.jpg" alt="wireframes"><div class="caption"></div></div></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Styles and Icons</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span class="project-p">The colors and icons for the app. I went with the classic red, white, and blue, 
since I was focusing on government representatives in the U.S.A. 
To convey the governmental nature of the app, graphics were designed around stars, flags, and government buildings.
The colors helped accent this tone. 
Color was also important to indicate political party.
Democrats would be given a blue icon, republicans would given a red icon, an independents/moderates/unknown party would not be given an icon.
The fonts Lato and Roboto offered strong readability. Varying fonts better highlighted information (e.g. Lato Bold for headers; Roboto for paragraph fonts and labels)</span><div class="img-container white-bg"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/style-guide.png" alt="styles"><div class="caption"></div></div></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Prototyping</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><h3 class="project-subheader">Code Prototypes are GREAT, but also time-consuming</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>The first prototype was created using React.js and Google Civic API. It was a great way to combine my programming skills with my design skills.
Having something fully interactable (compared to click-through prototypes) was helpful during user testing. There was greater insight into how someone would use GovContact in the wild.
However, a lot of time was invested in programming that could have been dedicated to reviewing design decisions or organizing a user study.
In the end, it was worth the investment, and I also better understand when a code prototype is needed. </span><h3 class="project-subheader">Link &amp; Screenshots to Prototype</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span> Here are screenshots of the 
first prototype. It can also be found by clicking </span><a class="link" href="https://gov-contact.herokuapp.com">here. </a><h3 class="project-subheader">First Screen: Search Bar</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>The first screen of the web app is for the user to search for the representatives, by address.
It starts with header, with a description of GovContact and a hero image to display brand.
The only interactable item is the search box to input an address.</span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/final-result.png" alt="final"><div class="caption"></div></div><h3 class="project-subheader">Second Screen: All the Reps</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>The second half of the app is to display all the representatives' information in a card format, which was decided upon in the wireframe stage.
Every representative is required to have atleast an email and phone number. A Twitter or Facebook handle will also be displayed.
All of this takes place on the same screen, right below the search bar.</span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/final-result2.png" alt="final"><div class="caption"></div></div></p></div><h2 class="project-header">User Testing</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span class="project-p">The web app was tested with 5 participants in an informal interview setting. Each participant explored the site on their own and was asked follow up questions.
Testing the app revealed: </span><ul class="project-list"><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Filtering and Sorting Options: </strong>Most participants spent a lot of time scrolling to learn about representatives. 
Every participant had some diffculty when asked to find a specific representative.
A sorting or filtering option would help solve this usability issue.</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Evaluating brand: </strong>Participants were asked to rate how well a given adjective described GovContact.
When given the adjective "politically neutral," most participants said it did not describe GovContact well.
Political party was the only thing that a citizen would know about a representative. 
There might be a better way to use color and brand to showcase GovContact in a more neutral way. </li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Web may not be right platform: </strong>Most participants they were more likely to use a search engine if they were already on a browser. 
As a website, GovContact may not provide as much value.</li></ul></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Turn to a Mobile App</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span>To provide better value, GovContact should be a mobile app. 
The idea came from a user testing participant who might store a representative's contact information on their mobile phone.
Although it was only a single participant who thought of this, the comment inspired an idea to create a contact book of government representatives.
There wouldn't be any link to follow. 
By taking up visual space inside a phone, the app would also serve as a reminder.
A mobile would also allow a person to call a representative directly from their phone.
The concept is to put your Senator in your contact book. 
</span></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Style Update</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span>After user feedback, I decided to update the brand of GovContact. 
Instead of contrasting, polarized colors of red and blue, the primary color is a purple, the unity of the former.
To convey the feeling of government, I used photographs of building and monuments.</span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/visual-design.png" alt="visual design"><div class="caption"></div></div></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Solution</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><h3 class="project-subheader">2-step Onboarding</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>GovContact doesn't require anyone to create an account or provide an email.
The only required information is a physical address that can be used to find the correpsonding reps.</span><div class="display-flex"><div class="grid-6"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/gc_start.png" alt="start"><div class="caption"></div></div></div><div class="grid-6"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/gc_address.png" alt="enter address"><div class="caption"></div></div></div></div><h3 class="project-subheader">Finding your rep</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>Each of the three levels of government has a different impact on a citizens life, so each represenative is chunked into their proper group.
Finding a rep is the same process as finding a contact in Messenger or Whatsapp.
I borrowed the familiar layout such that Briana or Terry could use GovContact as they would any other messaging app. </span><div class="display-flex"><div class="grid-6"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/gc_home.png" alt="home"><div class="caption"></div></div></div><div class="grid-6"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/gc_search.png" alt="search"><div class="caption"></div></div></div></div><h3 class="project-subheader">Everything you need to know</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>Based on the online research and interviews with government employees, the contact information for each rep is ordered by availability and effectiveness.
Although no political party is mentioned, Briana and Terry can understand how each of their reps stands on the issues. </span><div class="display-flex"><div class="grid-6"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/rep.png" alt="rep"><div class="caption"></div></div></div><div class="grid-6"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/rep-expanded.png" alt="rep expanded"><div class="caption"></div></div></div></div><h3 class="project-subheader">Made for mobile</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>When desiging the mobile, I used a diagram I found in an </span><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/the-thumb-zone-designing-for-mobile-users/">article by Smashing Magazine </a><span>to have the main actions of every screen at a natural reach to the user.</span><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/mobile-designed.png" alt="mobibly designed"><div class="caption"></div></div><h3 class="project-subheader">User Flow</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>I created a user flow to illustrate how each screen connects to one another. 
It was important to consider all the default and error states a user might encounter.
A link to the high fidelity user flow can be found </span><a href="overflow.io/s/IPM5WU">here</a><h3 class="project-subheader">InVision Prototype</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>The final step in the solution was to create a click-through prototype.
Time was a little short and there were no complex interactions, so a click-through prototype was more appropriate. 
An embed of the prototype can be found below.
</span><div class="img-container"><iframe width="438" height="930" src="//invis.io/CFRFG9WYVBE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Reflection and Next Steps</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><h3 class="project-subheader">Summary</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>GovContact is an app to connect citizens to their representatives. 
The process involved research, interviewing users, wireframing, branding, prototyping, and user testing.
The final solution was a mobile app in which citizens could learn about their representatives and contact them quickly.</span><h3 class="project-subheader">Future Steps</h3><p class="project-p"></p><span>The next steps for the app would be to test the click-through prototype with real users.
The purpose of the usability test is to identify the UX problems that ought to be fixed before development.
Afterwards, and iOS and Anroid app can be programmed and deployed to their respective stores. </span><h3 class="project-subheader">Possible Features</h3><p class="project-p"></p><ul class="project-list"><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Contact Templates: </strong>One additional feature to explore is templates for what to say to a representative. 
This could take the form of a script before calling or a template form for an email or social media post</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Social Sharing: </strong>Another important feature is having citizens encourage their friends and followers to contact their represenatives.
Government representatives are more likely to listen to a request if it came from a multitude of citizens.
If GovContact could have a social sharing feature, it might encourage other citizens to take action.</li></ul><h3 class="project-subheader">Lessons</h3><p class="project-p"></p><ul class="project-list"><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Understanding how to use brand: </strong>There was huge change in brand. It was in respect to better communicating the feeling of government, while also refraining from the colors of political parties.
In this manner, I was learned how to explore brand beyond the expected to create something unique.</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Knowing what type to prototype: </strong>I utilized two types of prototypes: code prototypes and click-through prototypes.
The web prototype made in React.js was useful for testing how someone would be most likely to interact with the app.
However programming took up a lot of time compared to the click-through protoype, which I could focus more on the design of GovContact.
The lesson I learned was when to use each kind of prototype.</li></ul></p></div></div></div><div class="break"></div><footer class="footer"><div class="super-container"><div class="footer-inner"> <div class="get-in-touch footer-section"><h3 class="footer-header header">Get in Touch</h3><p class="footer-p">Say hello at <a href="mailto:renoj@uconn.edu">renoj@uconn.edu</a></p><p class="weak">This site was proudly built in Pug, SASS, and Webpack</p></div><div class="footer-socials footer-section"><h3 class="footer-header header">Checkout More</h3><ul class="socials-list"><li class="socials-item"> <a class="socials-link" href="https://github.com/renojvarghese">GitHub</a></li><li class="socials-item"> <a class="socials-link" href="https://www.behance.net/renojvarghese">Behance</a></li><li class="socials-item"> <a class="socials-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/renoj-varghese/">LinkedIn</a></li></ul><a href="../../static/docs/resumeRenojVarghese.pdf">View Resume</a></div></div></div></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="../../main.js"></script></body></html>
