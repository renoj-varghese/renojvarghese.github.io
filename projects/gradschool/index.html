The experience is to build skills and a network to eventually pursue an academic endeavor or industry role. As The Graduate School at the Unviversity of Connecticut, our team supported  graduate students along their academic journeys through resources, programming, events, conflict mediation and other services.</p><p class="project-intro mb-xxl animate fade slide-down delay-small">My role as a Communications Designer was to create visual assets and copy for various social media, email, and web experiences. This particular case study will focus on my work in social media. </p><h3 class="animate fade slide-down delay-large">Overview</h3><div class="grid-2 flex animate fade slide-down delay-large"><div class="grid-2-item left"><p class="mb-l"><strong>Roles: </strong>Communications Designer, Social Media Strategist</p><p class="mb-l animate fade delay-large"><strong>Team: </strong>Marie Leblanc (Communications Lead), Jia Cai (Programming Assistant)</p><p class="animate fade delay-large"><strong>Duration: </strong>12 Weeks (and ongoing project)</p></div></div></div><div class="mt-separate project-container content-container"><h6>Results</h6><h3>Sharing Resources and Events</h3><p class="project-p">Our mission at The Graduate School is to help students along their journey. At different points in the semester, we created guides and shared resources to help students in their academic journey. This was particularly important for remote students, where resources were most likely to be seen online or on social media.</p><div class="grid-2 flex"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/resource-event-1.png" alt="resource-event-1.png"></div></div><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/resource-event-3.png" alt="resource-event-3.png"></div></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/resource-event-2.png" alt="resource-event-2.png"></div></div></div></div><h3>Keeping Students on Track with Reminders for Major Deadlines</h3><p class="project-p">Especially for students, it's easy for important deadlines to creep up quickly. To make sure graduate students didn't miss a thing, we shared the biggest academic ones that could reach them through their social feed.</p><div class="grid-2 flex"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/academic-reminder-1.png" alt="academic-reminder-1.png"></div></div><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/academic-reminder-3.png" alt="academic-reminder-3.png"></div></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/academic-reminder-2.png" alt="academic-reminder-2.png"></div></div></div></div><h3>Spotlighting UConn Students and Alumni</h3><p class="project-p">There are some amazing students and alumni from the University of Connecticut. We wanted to highlight their accomplishments to show current students their Husky community as well as to give prospective students an idea of what they can achieve.</p><div class="grid-2 flex"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/spotlight-1.png" alt="spotlight-1.png"></div></div><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/spotlight-3.png" alt="spotlight-3.png"></div></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/spotlight-2.png" alt="spotlight-2.png"></div></div><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/spotlight-4.png" alt="spotlight-4.png"></div></div></div></div><h3>Promoting Other Departmental Content</h3><p class="project-p">If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a community of departments to raise a graduate student. There were many events and resources that were shared by the main UConn brand and sibling departments. It was important to use to share this content and increase its reach.</p><div class="grid-2 flex"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/department-1.png" alt="department-1.png"></div></div><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/department-3.png" alt="department-3.png"></div></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/department-2.png" alt="department-2.png"></div></div></div></div><h3>Celebrating National, International, and Cultural Holidays</h3><p class="project-p">We commemorated the events and holidays that fall outside of academia. Our strategy was to celebrate common holidays alongside ones that promoted kindness and self-care. The latter was particularly important for stressful times such as mideterm and finals weeks.</p><div class="grid-2 flex"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/holiday-1.png" alt="holiday-1.png"></div></div><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/holiday-3.png" alt="holiday-3.png"></div></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/holiday-2.png" alt="holiday-2.png"></div></div></div></div><h3>Campus Photos to Highlight UConn</h3><p class="project-p">A fun campaign we started was to post seasonal pictures of on-campus scenery. We hoped to showcase the wonderful sights at UConn, especially for current students who are working remotely or prospective student who are interested in applying.</p><div class="grid-2 flex"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/campus-1.png" alt="campus-1.png"></div></div><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/campus-3.png" alt="campus-3.png"></div></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/campus-2.png" alt="campus-2.png"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="mt-separate project-container content-container"><h6>process</h6><h3>Social Media Strategy</h3><p class="project-p">One of our team goals was to create documentation on our social strategy. When creating content, we wanted to make sure it was consistent in communication and tone, even when new team members will be working on social. </p><div class="grid-2 flex"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/social-guide.png" alt="social-guide.png"></div></div><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/social-guide-2.png" alt="social-guide-2.png"></div></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><h4>Audience and Content Guides </h4><p class="project-p">Our first step in documentation was to go back to our audiences and how our social could help them in their goals.
Moving from here, we could consider what type of content would help each of our audiences them most and how often to post them. I was responsible for creating the final documentation based on feedack from my team. </p></div></div><div class="grid-2 flex mt-xxxl"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/social-language.png" alt="social-language.png"></div></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><h4>Language Guide</h4><p class="project-p">To keep a consistent tone, I developed a language guide that described how we write for our audiences. It requires a kind, friendly, and supportive tone. I documented these principles as well as common words to use. Next steps would be to document specific phrases and sentences as well. </p></div></div><div class="grid-2 flex mt-xxxl"><div class="grid-2-item left"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/social-calendar.png" alt="social-calendar.png"></div></div></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><h4>Social Media Calendar</h4><p class="project-p">At the end of every month, we begin planning the social media calendar for the following month. We gather events from organizations, find any major academic deadlines, and determine any holidays to celebrate. Through out the month, we might select specific days to highlight a student or post a campus photo.


</p></div></div></div><div class="mt-separate project-container content-container"><h3>Visual Design Guidelines</h3><p class="mb-m">One of major projects at The Graduate School was to define brand and visual system for our social media. My process involved getting input from other members of the team, experimenting with different visual styles, and then getting feedback from the Communication Lead.</p><p class="project-p">Our social strategy captures many different types of content, from academic reminders to fun celebration. For our visual design guidelines, we wanted to  <span class="bold">capture a wide range of tones and subject matters.</span></p><h4 class="mt-xxxl"> Typography</h4><p class="project-p">Varying categories of content, from formal academic reminders to fun posts about National Cookie Day, called for a wide range of typefaces. I decided to go with three different typefaces for social media, each one being used for a different mood. </p><div class="mb-xl"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/gs-typography.png" alt="gs-typography.png"></div></div><div class="mt-xxxl mb-s"><div class="bold">Type Hierarchy</div></div><p class="project-p">As these typefaces were used, I established a consistent hierarchy at which they could be used. These were helpful when creating content quickly and when designing social media templates. </p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/gs-hierarchy.png" alt="gs-hierarchy.png"></div><h4 class="mt-xxxl">Color</h4><p class="project-p">The same principle followed with color: sustaining a diverse set of colors. I decided to go with a lighly less saturated versions of each color to give a light softness and kindness to the brand. </p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/gs-color.png" alt="gs-color.png"></div><div class="mt-xxxl mb-s"><div class="bold">Usage of Palette</div></div><p class="project-p">With such a broad range of colors, there is the risk that too many could be used in a single composition. To get around this issue, every image post should use only 1-3 of the above colors, each of which can be split into tones and shades. </p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/gs-color-example.png" alt="gs-color-example.png"></div><h4 class="mt-xxxl"> Shape </h4><div class="grid-2 flex"><div class="grid-2-item left"><p class="project-p">To align to the established principles of kindness and friendliness, all illustrations and graphics should employ rounded shapes and lines to give an organic nature to all images. </p></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><div class="mb-xxl"><div class="img-container shadow"><img src="../../static/img/gradschool/gs-shape.png" alt="gs-shape.png"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="mt-separate project-container content-container"><h6>conclusion</h6><h3>Summary </h3><p class="project-p">The social media at UConn Grad School supports graduate students along their academic journeys. My role as Communications Designer focused on creating visual and written content as well as documentation to create a consistent theme of content and design.

We lost a major opportunity to connect with our students in person, especially when they were managing a remote academic life and external world events. It was important to reach our audiences with content that provided resources and encouraged self-care.</p><h4>Sailing the Ship as We Build it</h4><p class="project-p">Most of our social strategy cam from experimentation. We created and tested hypotheses on what content our graduate students would be most helpful to graduate students. As we tried out different ideas, we got closer to finalized social strategy and brand guidelines.</p><h3>Next Steps</h3><h4>Visual Exploration Round 2</h4><p class="project-p">The visual design language has come a long way from the beginning of Fall 2020. But there are some other elements to explore, such as patterns and photo treatments. THe goal is to understand if/how these can continue to give our brand a kind, friendly, and supportive feel. </p></div><div class="content-container project-container project-extra-padding"><a href="../../"><h3 class="mb-s small-caps">go back to home</h3></a></div></div><footer class="footer"></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="../../main.js"></script></body></html>
