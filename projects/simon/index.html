I adapted the idea to a central character of the weather app: Simon the Weather Man. 
His purpose is the be a ray of <strong>sunshine </strong>no matter what the sky looks like. His words and expressions show that <strong>brightness </strong>and <strong>playfulness.</strong></p><!--Although I only started with one character, a future feature would be to allow users to choose one of many weather reporters, each reflecting different races, genders, and body types.--><div class="img-container"><img class="lozad" src="../../static/img/simon/character-design.png" alt="character-design.png"></div></div><!--.content-container.project-containerh3 Character and Visual Design

In contrast to more informational approach, Simon Says the Weather is a more playful approach to reporting to the weather.</p><h5>Widget Plugins</h5><p class="mb-xxxl">Designed a Widgets feature to allow people to receive the forecast in the applications they already use. The purpose is to make sure people are prepared for the weather, even if they don't have the time to check the weather.</p><h3 class="mt-separate">Challenges and Lessons</h3><h5>Incorporating Illustrations into a UI</h5><p class="mb-xxxl">One of the challenges was finding a balance between illustration and information. A weather app has to be informative, but I wanted to also give it a more playful spin with illustrations. 
Trying different layouts and positions for Simon the Weatherman taught me how illustrations could not only be a part of the UI, but also support its accompanying information.
</p><h3 class="mt-separate">Next Steps</h3><h5>Inclusive Design</h5><p class="mb-xxxl">If I had more time on this project, I would want to design more weather reporters who would represent different races, gender expressions, and body types. The goal would be for users to be able to select the weather reporter they prefer. </p><h3 class="mb-xxl mt-separate">Final Screens</h3><div class="img-container"><img class="lozad" src="../../static/img/simon/results.png" alt="results.png"></div></div></div><div class="content-container project-container project-extra-padding"><a href="../../"><h3 class="mb-s small-caps">go back to home</h3></a></div></div></div><footer class="footer"></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="../../main.js"></script></body></html>
